# STAN-OSFGR-code
This is the code for our paper: "Spatial-Temporal Attention Network for Open-Set Fine-Grained Image Recognition", which is under preview of a journal. The authors of this paper are Jiayin Sun, Hong Wang, and Qiulei Dong. The code is based on https://github.com/sgvaze/osr_closed_set_all_you_need [1]

training the model on the CUB/Aircraft datasets:
run the train_CUB_Aircraft.py

testing the model on the CUB/Aircraft datasets:
run the test_CUB_Aircraft.py
